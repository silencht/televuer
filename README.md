# TeleVuer

The TeleVuer library is a specialized version of the Vuer library, designed to enable XR device-based teleoperation of Unitree Robotics robots. This library acts as a wrapper for Vuer, providing additional adaptations specifically tailored for Unitree Robotics. By integrating XR device capabilities, such as hand tracking and controller tracking, TeleVuer facilitates seamless interaction and control of robotic systems in immersive environments.

Currently, this module serves as a core component of the [xr_teleoperate](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/xr_teleoperate) library, offering advanced functionality for teleoperation tasks. It supports various XR devices, including Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest3, Pico 4 Ultra Enterprise etc., ensuring compatibility and ease of use for robotic teleoperation applications.

## Release Note
V3.0 brings updates:
1. Added `pass_through` interface to enable/disable the pass-through mode.
2. Support `webrtc` interface to enable/disable the webrtc streaming mode.
3. Use `render_to_xr` method (adjust from `set_display_image`) to send images to XR device.

V2.0 brings updates:

1. Image transport is now by reference instead of external shared memory.
2. Renamed the get-data function from `get_motion_state_data` to `get_tele_data`.
3. Fixed naming errors (`waist` â†’ `wrist`)
4. Var name align with **vuer** conventions.
5. Streamlined the data structure: removed the nested `TeleStateData` and return everything in the unified `TeleData`.
6. Added new image-transport interfaces such as `set_display_image`.

## Install

```bash
cd televuer
pip install -e .
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```

## Test

```bash
python _test_televuer.py 
# or 
python _test_tv_wrapper.py

# First, use Apple Vision Pro or Pico 4 Ultra Enterprise to connect to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.
# Next, open safari / pico browser, enter https://host machine's ip:8012/?ws=wss://host machine's ip:8012
# for example, https://192.168.123.2:8012?ws=wss://192.168.123.2:8012
# Use the appropriate method (hand gesture or controller) to click the "pass-through" button in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

# Press Enter in the terminal to launch the program.
```

---

`vuer==0.0.36rc1` to `vuer==0.0.42rc16`

- **Functionality**:
  - Hand tracking only shows a flat RGB image (no stereo view).
  - PICO hand and controller tracking behave the same, with occasional right-eye blackouts at startup.
  - Hand or controller markers are displayed as either black boxes (`vuer==0.0.36rc1`) or RGB three-axis color coordinates (`vuer==0.0.42rc16`).

---

`vuer==0.0.42` to `vuer==0.0.45`

- **Functionality**:
  - Hand tracking only shows a flat RGB image (no stereo view).
  - Unable to retrieve hand tracking data.
  - Controller tracking only shows a flat RGB image (no stereo view), but controller data can be retrieved.

---

`vuer==0.0.46` to `vuer==0.0.56`

- **Functionality**:
  - AVP hand tracking works fine.
  - In PICO hand tracking mode:
    - Using a hand gesture to click the "Virtual Reality" button causes the screen to stay black and stuck loading.
    - Using the controller to click the button works fine.
  - In PICO controller tracking mode:
    - Using the controller to click the "Virtual Reality" button causes the screen to stay black and stuck loading.
    - Using a hand gesture to click the button works fine.
  - Hand marker visualization is displayed as RGB three-axis color coordinates.

## Tested Devices
please refer to our wiki doc [XR Device](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/xr_teleoperate/wiki/XR_Device)

## Notes
- **Recommended Version**: Use `vuer==0.0.60` for the best functionality and stability.
- **Black Screen Issue**: On PICO devices, choose the appropriate interaction method (hand gesture or controller) based on the mode to avoid black screen issues.
